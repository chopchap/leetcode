# Recursion
---
## Principle of Recursion
1. A simple _**base case**_ (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario
2. A set of rules, also known as _**recurrence relation**_ that reduces all other cases towards the base case
## Recursion Function
1. Break the problem down into smaller scopes: x0, x1, ..., xn
2. Call function (F(x0), ..., F(xn)) recursively to solve the subproblems of X
3. Finally, process the results from the recursive function calls to solve the problem corresponding to X
